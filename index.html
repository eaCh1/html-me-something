                <h2 class="ampersand">&amp; the distant past</h2>
                <p>
                    I was happy to leave my food cart job because consequently, I tried to access unemployment benefits.
                    At the WorkSource office, I was referred to a program called CodeOregon. It offered a
                    free subscription to TreeHouse, an online learning website. I studied PHP for my first language.
                    I was familiar with HTML and CSS from tweaking online profiles.
                </p>
                <h2 class="ampersand">&amp; the recent past</h2>
                <p>
                    I completed the PHP program at the same time that I got promoted at my restaurant job.
                    My computer coding skills took a back-seat to my development of certain soft-skills.
                    I never lost interest in the possibilities for my future with learning how to code,

                    I studied Java through Android development
                </p>
                <h2 class="ampersand">&amp; the present</h2>
                <p>
                    I was encouraged to apply for LaunchCode program from my friend who is active with
                    PDXWiT. I had heard of the non-profit, but I was not aware they were starting a cohort
                    in Portland, OR. The program culls from the start by introducing computer science concepts
                    throught the study of Python. The language reads like human English, and it more forgiving to
                    a newbie, in terms of demand for sermicolons and brackets for every action. The program is now
                    focusing on how to develop a "full stack" web app. It will utilize a cipher we wrote in Python by
                    having us place it into a web form.
                </p>
                <h2 class="ampersand">&amp; the future</h2>
                <p>
                    I have many interests in this field and I'm struggling to figure which I should focus on to
                    play into job placement. I am thinking of studying up more on databases. I liked using SQL with PHP
                    and in my time studying Java, I like how it used SQL to create local databases. It seems knowing how to manage
                    databases is a desirable skill.
