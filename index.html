                <p>I can be happy I quit my terrible job, because I tried to get unemployment benefits.
                    At the WorkSource office I was referred to a program called CodeOregon. 
                    With this, I was offered a free subscription to TreeHouse.
                    I studied PHP for my first language.</p>
